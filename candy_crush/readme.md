## Crushing Candy Code

A local chain of candy stores has hired you to draw conclusions from their sales data. This is made difficult by the fact that each store keeps track of their own inventory sales in a slightly different manner. Use the data sets contained in each folder to complete the exercises.

### Recommended execution of these exercises
Write your code as functions that result in a ```console.log()``` and then run ```node (filename)``` on the command line.

### Tips
* Be sure to review dot notation vs. bracket notation and when you need to use one over the other.
* You will be using array and object methods, if you're not comfortable with these, [review this.](https://github.com/robhaj/js-array-and-string-manipulation)
